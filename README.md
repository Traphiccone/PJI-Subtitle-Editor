HOW TO:
Be sure your footage is backed up in a seperate location before proceeding. 
Drop the .exe file in the same location as your DJI subtitle files.
Run the program and follow the prompts.

If uploading a clip directly to youtube upload the new SRT file that was generated.

If editing the video first in software such as Premiere Pro, import the clip and new SRT file,
drop them both in the timeline.  Line up the SRT file with the beginning of the clip and link or
nest the two together.  You can now trim the clips freely and accurate altitude information will be
generated on the fly.  When your final project is rendered be sure to export a new SRT file for uploading
to YouTube.

In the YouTube player toggle the CC (closed captioning) button to turn on your altitude information!
